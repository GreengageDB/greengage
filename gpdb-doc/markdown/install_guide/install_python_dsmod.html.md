## <a id="topic_instpdsm"></a>Installing a Data Science Package for Python 

Before you install a Data Science Package for Python, make sure that your Greenplum Database is running, you have sourced `greenplum_path.sh`, and that the `$COORDINATOR_DATA_DIRECTORY` and `$GPHOME` environment variables are set.

> **Note** The `PyMC3` module depends on `Tk`. If you want to use `PyMC3`, you must install the `tk` OS package on every node in your cluster. For example:

```
$ sudo yum install tk
```

1.  Locate the Data Science Package for Python that you built or downloaded.

    The file name format of the package is `DataSciencePython<pythonversion>-<data-science-bundle-version>-gp7-rhel<n>-x86_64.gppkg`.  For example: `DataSciencePython3.11-3.0.0-gp7-rhel8_x86_64.gppkg`.

2.  Copy the package to the Greenplum Database coordinator host.
3.  Follow the instructions in [Verifying the Greenplum Database Software Download](../install_guide/verify_sw.html) to verify the integrity of the *Greenplum Procedural Languages Python Data Science Package* software.
4.  Use the `gppkg` command to install the package. For example:

    ```
    $ gppkg install DataSciencePython3.11-1.2.0-gp7-el8_x86_64.gppkg
    ```

    `gppkg` installs the Data Science Package for Python modules on all nodes in your Greenplum Database cluster. The command also updates the `PYTHONPATH`, `PATH`, and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables in your `greenplum_path.sh` file.

5.  Restart Greenplum Database. You must re-source `greenplum_path.sh` before restarting your Greenplum cluster:

    ```
    $ source /usr/local/greenplum-db/greenplum_path.sh
    $ gpstop -r
    ```


The Data Science Package for Python modules are installed in the following directory:

```
$GPHOME/ext/DataSciencePython/lib/python3.11/site-packages/
```

## <a id="topic_removepdsm"></a>Uninstalling a Data Science Package for Python 

Use the `gppkg` utility to uninstall a Data Science Package for Python. You must include the version number in the package name you provide to `gppkg`.

To determine your Data Science Package for Python version number and remove this package:

```
$ gppkg query | grep DataSciencePython
DataSciencePython-<version>
$ gppkg remove DataSciencePython-<version>
```

The command removes the Data Science Package for Python modules from your Greenplum Database cluster. It also updates the `PYTHONPATH`, `PATH`, and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables in your `greenplum_path.sh` file to their pre-installation values.

Re-source `greenplum_path.sh` and restart Greenplum Database after you remove the Python Data Science Module package:

```
$ . /usr/local/greenplum-db/greenplum_path.sh
$ gpstop -r 
```

> **Note** After you uninstall a Data Science Package for Python from your Greenplum Database cluster, any UDFs that you have created that import Python modules installed with this package will return an error.
