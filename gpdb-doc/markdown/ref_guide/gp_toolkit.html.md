# The gp\_toolkit Administrative Schema 

VMware Greenplum provides an administrative schema called `gp_toolkit` that you can use to query the system catalogs, log files, and operating environment for system status information. The `gp_toolkit` schema contains a number of views that you can access using SQL commands. The `gp_toolkit` schema is accessible to all database users, although some objects may require superuser permissions. For convenience, you may want to add the `gp_toolkit` schema to your schema search path. For example:

```
=> ALTER ROLE myrole SET search_path TO myschema,gp_toolkit;
```

This documentation describes the most useful views and user-defined functions (UDFs) in `gp_toolkit`. You may notice other objects (views, functions, and external tables) within the `gp_toolkit` schema that are not described in this documentation (these are supporting objects to the views described in this section).

> **Caution** Do not change database objects in the gp\_toolkit schema. Do not create database objects in the schema. Changes to objects in the schema might affect the accuracy of administrative information returned by schema objects. Any changes made in the gp\_toolkit schema are lost when the database is backed up and then restored with the `gpbackup` and `gprestore` utilities.

These are the categories for views in the `gp_toolkit` schema.

## <a id="about"></a>About the Extension

`gp_toolkit` is implemented as an extension in Greenplum 7. Because this extension is registered in the `template1` database, it is both registered an immediately available to use in every Greenplum database that you create.

## <a id="upgrade"></a>Upgrading the Extension

The `gp_toolkit` extension is installed when you install or upgrade VMware Greenplum. A previous version of the extension will continue to work in existing databases after you upgrade Greenplum. To upgrade to the most recent version of the extension, you must:

```
ALTER EXTENSION gp_toolkit UPDATE TO '1.4';
```

in **every** database in which you use the extension.

## <a id="topic2"></a>Checking for Tables that Need Routine Maintenance 

The following views can help identify tables that need routine table maintenance \(`VACUUM` and/or `ANALYZE`\).

-   [gp\_bloat\_diag](#topic3)
-   [gp\_stats\_missing](#topic4)

The `VACUUM` or `VACUUM FULL` command reclaims disk space occupied by deleted or obsolete rows. Because of the MVCC transaction concurrency model used in VMware Greenplum, data rows that are deleted or updated still occupy physical space on disk even though they are not visible to any new transactions. Expired rows increase table size on disk and eventually slow down scans of the table.

The `ANALYZE` command collects column-level statistics needed by the query optimizer. VMware Greenplum uses a cost-based query optimizer that relies on database statistics. Accurate statistics allow the query optimizer to better estimate selectivity and the number of rows retrieved by a query operation in order to choose the most efficient query plan.

**Parent topic:** [The gp\_toolkit Administrative Schema](gp_toolkit.html)

### <a id="topic3"></a>gp\_bloat\_diag 

This view shows regular heap-storage tables that have bloat \(the actual number of pages on disk exceeds the expected number of pages given the table statistics\). Tables that are bloated require a `VACUUM` or a `VACUUM FULL` in order to reclaim disk space occupied by deleted or obsolete rows. This view is accessible to all users, however non-superusers will only be able to see the tables that they have permission to access.

> **Note** For diagnostic functions that return append-optimized table information, see [Checking Append-Optimized Tables](#topic8).

|Column|Description|
|------|-----------|
|bdirelid|Table object id.|
|bdinspname|Schema name.|
|bdirelname|Table name.|
|bdirelpages|Actual number of pages on disk.|
|bdiexppages|Expected number of pages given the table data.|
|bdidiag|Bloat diagnostic message.|

### <a id="topic4"></a>gp\_stats\_missing 

This view shows tables that do not have statistics and therefore may require an `ANALYZE` be run on the table.

|Column|Description|
|------|-----------|
|smischema|Schema name.|
|smitable|Table name.|
|smisize|Does this table have statistics? False if the table does not have row count and row sizing statistics recorded in the system catalog, which may indicate that the table needs to be analyzed. This will also be false if the table does not contain any rows. For example, the parent tables of partitioned tables are always empty and will always return a false result.|
|smicols|Number of columns in the table.|
|smirecs|The total number of columns in the table that have statistics recorded.|

## <a id="topic5"></a>Checking for Locks 

When a transaction accesses a relation \(such as a table\), it acquires a lock. Depending on the type of lock acquired, subsequent transactions may have to wait before they can access the same relation. For more information on the types of locks, see the [Managing Data](../admin_guide/managing_data.html)topic. VMware Greenplum resource queues \(used for resource management\) also use locks to control the admission of queries into the system.

The `gp_locks_*` family of views can help diagnose queries and sessions that are waiting to access an object due to a lock.

-   [gp\_locks\_on\_relation](#topic6)
-   [gp\_locks\_on\_resqueue](#topic7)

**Parent topic:** [The gp\_toolkit Administrative Schema](gp_toolkit.html)

### <a id="topic6"></a>gp\_locks\_on\_relation

## <a id="topic8"></a>Checking Append-Optimized Tables 

The `gp_toolkit` schema includes a set of diagnostic functions you can use to investigate the state of append-optimized tables.

When an append-optimized table \(or column-oriented append-optimized table\) is created, another table is implicitly created, containing metadata about the current state of the table. The metadata includes information such as the number of records in each of the table's segments.

Append-optimized tables may have non-visible rowsâ€”rows that have been updated or deleted, but remain in storage until the table is compacted using `VACUUM`. The hidden rows are tracked using an auxiliary visibility map table, or visimap.

The following functions let you access the metadata for append-optimized and column-oriented tables and view non-visible rows.

For most of the functions, the input argument is `regclass`, either the table `name` or the `oid` of a table.

**Parent topic:** [The gp\_toolkit Administrative Schema](gp_toolkit.html)

### <a id="topic_ylp_gxw_yq"></a>\_\_gp\_aovisimap\_compaction\_info\(oid\) 

This function displays compaction information for an append-optimized table. The information is for the on-disk data files on database segments that store the table data. You can use the information to determine the data files that will be compacted by a `VACUUM` operation on an append-optimized table.

> **Note** Until a VACUUM operation deletes the row from the data file, deleted or updated data rows occupy physical space on disk even though they are hidden to new transactions. The configuration parameter [gp\_appendonly\_compaction](config_params/guc-list.html) controls the functionality of the `VACUUM` command.

This table describes the \_\_gp\_aovisimap\_compaction\_info function output table.

|Column|Description|
|------|-----------|

|hidden\_tupcount|In the data file, the number of hidden \(deleted or updated\) rows.|
|total\_tupcount|In the data file, the total number of rows.|
|percent\_hidden|In the data file, the ratio \(as a percentage\) of hidden \(deleted or updated\) rows to total rows.|

## <a id="topic21"></a>Checking Server Configuration Files 

Each component of a VMware Greenplum system \(coordinator, standby coordinator, primary segments, and mirror segments\) has its own server configuration file \(`postgresql.conf`\). The following `gp_toolkit` objects can be used to check parameter settings across all primary `postgresql.conf` files in the system:

-   [gp\_param\_setting\('parameter\_name'\)](#topic22)
-   [gp\_param\_settings\_seg\_value\_diffs](#topic23)

**Parent topic:** [The gp\_toolkit Administrative Schema](gp_toolkit.html)

### <a id="topic22"></a>gp\_param\_setting\('parameter\_name'\) 

This function takes the name of a server configuration parameter and returns the `postgresql.conf` value for the coordinator and each active segment. This function is accessible to all users.

|Column|Description|
|------|-----------|
|paramsegment|The segment content id \(only active segments are shown\). The coordinator content id is always -1.|
|paramname|The name of the parameter.|
|paramvalue|The value of the parameter.|

#### <a id="ie192970"></a>Example: 

```
SELECT * FROM gp_param_setting('max_connections');
```

### <a id="topic23"></a>gp\_param\_settings\_seg\_value\_diffs 

Server configuration parameters that are classified as *local* parameters \(meaning each segment gets the parameter value from its own `postgresql.conf` file\), should be set identically on all segments. This view shows local parameter settings that are inconsistent. Parameters that are supposed to have different values \(such as `port`\) are not included. This view is accessible to all users.

|Column|Description|
|------|-----------|
|psdname|The name of the parameter.|
|psdvalue|The value of the parameter.|

## <a id="topic26x"></a>Checking Resource Group Activity and Status 

> **Note** The resource group activity and status views described in this section are valid only when resource group-based resource management is active.

Resource groups manage transactions to avoid exhausting system CPU and memory resources. Every database user is assigned a resource group. VMware Greenplum evaluates every transaction submitted by a user against the limits configured for the user's resource group before running the transaction.

You can use the `gp_resgroup_config` view to check the configuration of each resource group. You can use the `gp_resgroup_status*` views to display the current transaction status and resource usage of each resource group.

-   [gp\_resgroup\_config](#topic27x)
-   [gp_resgroup_role](#role)
-   [gp\_resgroup\_status](#topic31x)

### <a id="role"></a>gp\_resgroup\_role

The `gp_resgroup_role` view allows administrators to see the resource group assigned to every role.

This view is accessible to all users.

|Column|Description|
|------|-----------|
|rrrolname|The name of the role|
|rrrsgname|The name of the resource group|

### <a id="topic31x"></a>gp\_resgroup\_status 

The `gp_resgroup_status` view allows administrators to see status and activity for a resource group. It shows how many queries are waiting to run and how many queries are currently active in the system for each resource group. The view also displays current memory and CPU usage for the resource group.

> **Note** Resource groups use the Linux control groups \(cgroups\) configured on the host systems. The cgroups are used to manage host system resources. When resource groups use cgroups that are as part of a nested set of cgroups, resource group limits are relative to the parent cgroup allotment. For information about nested cgroups and VMware Greenplum resource group limits, see [Using Resource Groups](../admin_guide/workload_mgmt_resgroups.html#topic8339intro).

This view is accessible to all users.

## <a id="topic26"></a>Checking Resource Queue Activity and Status 

> **Note** The resource queue activity and status views described in this section are valid only when resource queue-based resource management is active.

The purpose of resource queues is to limit the number of active queries in the system at any given time in order to avoid exhausting system resources such as memory, CPU, and disk I/O. All database users are assigned to a resource queue, and every statement submitted by a user is first evaluated against the resource queue limits before it can run. The `gp_resq_*` family of views can be used to check the status of statements currently submitted to the system through their respective resource queue. Note that statements issued by superusers are exempt from resource queuing.

-   [gp\_resq\_activity](#topic27)
-   [gp\_resq\_activity\_by\_queue](#topic28)
-   [gp\_resq\_priority\_statement](#topic29)
-   [gp\_resq\_role](#topic30)

## <a id="topic32"></a>Checking Query Disk Spill Space Usage 

The *gp\_workfile\_\** views show information about all the queries that are currently using disk spill space. VMware Greenplum creates work files on disk if it does not have sufficient memory to run the query in memory. This information can be used for troubleshooting and tuning queries. The information in the views can also be used to specify the values for the VMware Greenplum configuration parameters `gp_workfile_limit_per_query` and `gp_workfile_limit_per_segment`.

## <a id="topic36"></a>Viewing Users and Groups \(Roles\) 

It is frequently convenient to group users \(roles\) together to ease management of object privileges: that way, privileges can be granted to, or revoked from, a group as a whole. In VMware Greenplum, this is done by creating a role that represents the group, and then granting membership in the group role to individual user roles.

The [gp\_roles\_assigned](#topic37) view can be used to see all of the roles in the system, and their assigned members \(if the role is also a group role\).

**Parent topic:** [The gp\_toolkit Administrative Schema](gp_toolkit.html)

### <a id="topic37"></a>gp\_roles\_assigned 

This view shows all of the roles in the system, and their assigned members \(if the role is also a group role\). This view is accessible to all users.

|ramembername|Name of the role that is a member of this role.|

## <a id="topic38"></a>Checking Database Object Sizes and Disk Space 

The `gp_size_*` family of views can be used to determine the disk space usage for a distributed VMware Greenplum database, schema, table, or index. The following views calculate the total size of an object across all primary segments \(mirrors are not included in the size calculations\).

-   [gp\_size\_of\_all\_table\_indexes](#topic39)
-   [gp\_size\_of\_database](#topic40)
-   [gp\_size\_of\_index](#topic41)
-   [gp\_size\_of\_schema\_disk](#topic43)
-   [gp\_size\_of\_table\_and\_indexes\_disk](#topic44)
-   [gp\_size\_of\_table\_and\_indexes\_licensing](#topic45)
-   [gp\_size\_of\_table\_disk](#topic46)
-   [gp\_size\_of\_table\_uncompressed](#topic47)
-   [gp\_disk\_free](#topic48)

The table and index sizing views list the relation by object ID \(not by name\). To check the size of a table or index by name, you must look up the relation name \(`relname`\) in the `pg_class` table. For example:

```
SELECT relname as name, sotdsize as size, sotdtoastsize as 
toast, sotdadditionalsize as other 
FROM gp_size_of_table_disk as sotd, pg_class 
WHERE sotd.sotdoid=pg_class.oid ORDER BY relname;

## <a id="missingfiles"></a>Checking for Missing and Orphaned Data Files

VMware Greenplum considers a relation data file that is present in the catalog, but not on disk, to be missing. Conversely, when Greenplum encounters an unexpected data file on disk that is not referenced in any relation, it considers that file to be orphaned.

VMware Greenplum provides the following views to help identify if missing or orphaned files exist in the current database:

- [gp_check_orphaned_files](#mf_orphaned)
- [gp_check_missing_files](#mf_missing)
- [gp_check_missing_files_ext](#mf_missing_ext)

Consider it a best practice to check for these conditions prior to expanding the cluster or before offline maintenance.

By default, the views identified in this section are available to `PUBLIC`.

### <a id="mf_orphaned"></a>gp_check_orphaned_files

The `gp_check_orphaned_files` view scans the default and user-defined tablespaces for orphaned data files. VMware Greenplum considers normal data files, files with an underscore (`_`) in the name, and extended numbered files (files that contain a `.<N>` in the name) in this check. `gp_check_orphaned_files` gathers results from the VMware Greenplum coordinator and all segments.

|Column|Description|
|------|-----------|
| gp_segment_id | The database segment identifier. |
| tablespace | The identifier of the tablespace in which the orphaned file resides. |
| filename | The file name of the orphaned data file. |
| filepath | The file system path of the orphaned data file, relative to the data directory of the coordinator or segment. |

> **Caution** Use this view as one of many data points to identify orphaned data files. Do not delete files based solely on results from querying this view.

### <a id="mf_missing"></a>gp_check_missing_files

The `gp_check_missing_files` view scans heap and append-optimized, column-oriented tables for missing data files. Greenplum considers only normal data files (files that do not contain a `.` or an `_` in the name) in this check. `gp_check_missing_files` gathers results from the VMware Greenplum coordinator and all segments.

|Column|Description|
|------|-----------|
| gp_segment_id | The database segment identifier. |
| tablespace | The identifier of the tablespace in which the table resides. |
| relname | The name of the table that has a missing data file(s). |
| filename | The file name of the missing data file. |


### <a id="mf_missing_ext"></a>gp_check_missing_files_ext

The `gp_check_missing_files_ext` view scans only append-optimized, column-oriented tables for missing extended data files. VMware Greenplum considers both normal data files and extended numbered files (files that contain a `.<N>` in the name) in this check. Files that contain an `_` in the name are not considered. `gp_check_missing_files_ext` gathers results from the VMware Greenplum database segments only.

|Column|Description|
|------|-----------|
| gp_segment_id | The database segment identifier. |
| tablespace | The identifier of the tablespace in which the table resides. |
| relname | The name of the table that has a missing extended data file(s). |
| filename | The file name of the missing extended data file. |

## <a id="moveorphanfiles"></a>Moving Orphaned Data Files

The `gp_move_orphaned_files()` user-defined function (UDF) moves orphaned files found by the [gp_check_orphaned_files](#mf_orphaned) view into a file system location that you specify.

The function signature is: `gp_move_orphaned_files( <target_directory> TEXT )`.

`<target_directory>` must exist on all segment hosts before you move the files, and the specified directory must be accessible by the `gpadmin` user. If you specify a relative path for `<target_directory>`, it is considered relative to the data directory of the coordinator or segment.

VMware Greenplum renames each moved data file to one that reflects the original location of the file in the data directory. The file name format differs depending on the tablespace in which the orphaned file resides:

| Tablespace | Renamed File Format|
|------|-----------|
| default | `seg<num>_base_<database-oid>_<relfilenode>` |
| global | `seg<num>_global_<relfilenode>` |
| user-defined | `seg<num>_pg_tblspc_<tablespace-oid>_<gpdb-version>_<database-oid>_<relfilenode>` |

For example, if a file named `12345` in the default tablespace is orphaned on primary segment 2,

```
SELECT * FROM gp_move_orphaned_files('/home/gpadmin/orphaned');
```

moves and renames the file as follows:

| Original Location | New Location and File Name |
|------|-----------|
| `<data_directory>/base/13700/12345` | `/home/gpadmin/orphaned/seg2_base_13700_12345` |

`gp_move_orphaned_files()` returns both the original and the new file system locations for each file that it moves, and also provides an indication of the success or failure of the move operation. For example:

```
SELECT * FROM gp_toolkit.gp_move_orphaned_files('/home/gpadmin/orphaned');
 gp_segment_id | move_success |           oldpath          |         newpath
---------------+--------------+----------------------------+-----------------------------------
            -1 | t            | /<data_dir>/base/13715/99999 | /home/gpadmin/orphaned/seg-1_base_13715_99999
             1 | t            | /<data_dir>/base/13715/99999 | /home/gpadmin/orphaned/seg1_base_13715_99999
             2 | t            | /<data_dir>/base/13715/99999 | /home/gpadmin/orphaned/seg2_base_13715_99999
(3 rows)
```

Once you move the files, you may choose to remove them or to back them up.

## <a id="topic49"></a>Checking for Uneven Data Distribution 

All tables in VMware Greenplum are distributed, meaning their data is divided across all of the segments in the system. If the data is not distributed evenly, then query processing performance may decrease. The following views can help diagnose if a table has uneven data distribution:

-   [gp\_skew\_coefficients](#topic50)
-   [gp\_skew\_idle\_fractions](#topic51)

**Parent topic:** [The gp\_toolkit Administrative Schema](gp_toolkit.html)

### <a id="topic50"></a>gp\_skew\_coefficients 

This view shows data distribution skew by calculating the coefficient of variation \(CV\) for the data stored on each segment. This view is accessible to all users, however non-superusers will only be able to see tables that they have permission to access

|Column|Description|
|------|-----------|
|skcoid|The object id of the table.|
|skcnamespace|The namespace where the table is defined.|
|skcrelname|The table name.|
|skccoeff|The coefficient of variation \(CV\) is calculated as the standard deviation divided by the average. It takes into account both the average and variability around the average of a data series. The lower the value, the better. Higher values indicate greater data skew.|

### <a id="topic51"></a>gp\_skew\_idle\_fractions 

This view shows data distribution skew by calculating the percentage of the system that is idle during a table scan, which is an indicator of processing data skew. This view is accessible to all users, however non-superusers will only be able to see tables that they have permission to access

|Column|Description|
|------|-----------|
|sifoid|The object id of the table.|
|sifnamespace|The namespace where the table is defined.|
|sifrelname|The table name.|
|siffraction|The percentage of the system that is idle during a table scan, which is an indicator of uneven data distribution or query processing skew. For example, a value of 0.1 indicates 10% skew, a value of 0.5 indicates 50% skew, and so on. Tables that have more than 10% skew should have their distribution policies evaluated.|

## <a id="maintaining_partitions"></a>Maintaining Partitions

If your database employs partitions you will need to perform certain tasks regularly to help maintain those partitions. VMware Greenplum includes a view and a number of user-defined functions to help with these tasks. 

### The gp_partitions View

The `gp_partitions` view shows all leaf partitions in a database.

This view provides backwards compatibility with the legacy `pg_partitions` view (available in earlier major versions of VMware Greenplum). 

|Column|Type|Description|
|------|------|---------|
|schemaname|name|The name of the schema the partitioned table is in.|
|tablename|name|The name of the top-level parent table.|
|partitionschemaname|name|The schema of the partition table.|
|partitiontablename|name|The relation name of the partitioned table (this is the table name to use if accessing the partition directly).|
|parentpartitiontablename|regclass|The relation name of the parent table one level up from this partition.|
