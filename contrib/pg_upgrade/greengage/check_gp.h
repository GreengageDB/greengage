/*
 * This query gathers all the root (rp) and child (cp1 and cp2) partition
 * information necessary to detect if a partition table is a heterogeneous
 * partition table. The WHERE filter compares the root and child partition
 * information to exclude out the valid homogeneous partition table
 * definitions (as documented in the check_heterogeneous_partition() header).
 *
 * Note: We ignore subroot partitions because they also do not have data like
 * the root partition. We also defer partition tables where the root partition
 * and all of its child partitions have the same dropped column reference but
 * at least one child partition has extra dropped column references (the
 * CHECK_PARTITION_TABLE_MATCHES_DROPPED_COLUMN_ATTRIBUTES query will catch
 * these special problematic child partitions).
