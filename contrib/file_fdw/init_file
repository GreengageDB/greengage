# There are a number of NOTICE and HINT messages around table distribution,
# for example to inform the user that the database will pick a particular
# column in order to distribute the data. Merging tests from postgres will
# cause the tests to output these messages and we would need to manually
# modify the corresponding expected output. Hence we want to ignore these.
# Some of the messages include:
#
# NOTICE:  Table doesn't have 'DISTRIBUTED BY' clause -- Using column named '<colname>' as the Greenplum Database data distribution key for this table.
# NOTICE:  Table doesn't have 'DISTRIBUTED BY' clause, defaulting to distribution columns from LIKE table
# HINT:  The 'DISTRIBUTED BY' clause determines the distribution of data. Make sure column(s) chosen are the optimal data distribution key to minimize skew.
#
# The following regex is intended to cover all permutations of the above set
# of messages.
m/^(?:HINT|NOTICE):\s+.+\'DISTRIBUTED BY\' clause.*/

# The following NOTICE is generated when creating a role. It is to inform the
# user that the database will assign the default resource queue or default resource
# group to the role if the user has not explicitly specified one. Merging tests
# from postgres will cause the tests to output these messages and we would need
# to manually modify the corresponding expected output. Hence we want to ignore these.
m/^NOTICE:  resource group required -- using .* resource group ".*"$/

# Ignore creating zero-column table warning
m/^WARNING:  creating a table with no columns./
