 * The CATALOG definition has to refer to the type of "time" as
 * "timestamptz" (lower case) so that bootstrap mode recognizes it.  But
 * the C header files define this type as TimestampTz.	Since the field is
 * potentially-null and therefore cannot be accessed directly from C code,
 * there is no particular need for the C struct definition to show the
 * field type as TimestampTz --- instead we just make it Datum.
