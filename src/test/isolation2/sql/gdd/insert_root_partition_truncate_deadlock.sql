-- Insert statement on root partition, if GDD is enabled, QD will not lock leaf
-- parititions for better concurrency performance. So when the insert statement
-- is dispatched to segments async, some of statement will lock leaf partition
-- and execute, some might be blocked by other sessions and lead to global
-- deadlock. This test file is in GDD suites, it verify that such deadlock can
-- be broken by GDD.
-- See Issue https://github.com/GreengageDB/greengage/issues/13652 for details.

-- NOTE: this test case is better to run both with GDD and withoug GDD.
-- with GDD it is running within gdd test suites to test GDD can break the deadlock;
-- without GDD it is running to show that no deadlock happens.
