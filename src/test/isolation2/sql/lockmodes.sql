--
-- The function generate_partition_qual() will behave differently depends on
-- the existence of the relcache.
--
-- - if the relation is not cached, it will open it in AccessShareLock mode,
--   and save the relpartbound in the relcache;
-- - if the relation is already cached, it will load the relpartbound from the
--   cache directly without opening the relation;
--
-- So as a result, in the following transactions we will see an extra
-- AccessShareLock lock in a --enable-cassert build compared to a
-- --disable-cassert build.
--
-- To make the test results stable, we do not reuse the sessions in the test,
-- all the tests are performed without the relcache.
