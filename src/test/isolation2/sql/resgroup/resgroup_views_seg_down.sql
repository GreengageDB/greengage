-- The test below checks that FTS can break the stuck cancelled/terminated
-- query, if one of the segments has hanged.
-- Original problem was:
-- 1. For some reason (the reason itself is not important) at some point segment hangs.
-- 2. Query to 'gp_resgroup_status_per_segment' also hangs.
-- 3. If 'pg_cancel_backend' or 'pg_terminate_backend' is called before FTS makes
-- promotion, the query stays is stuck condition.

-- Change FTS settings to make FTS probe work faster in the test.
