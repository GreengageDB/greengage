-- Test push join below union all feature
--
-- Generation of join below union all alternative can be verified
-- using GUC optimizer_print_xform_results
--
-- This alternative is generated for all queries in this suite, 
-- except for the join of two union all test, and cte test
-- 
-- ORCA's cost model determines whether to choose this alternative
--
-- Intuitively, join below union is desirable when (1) the union all
-- children can benefit from physical join options not available 
-- after the union all operation, such as indexed nested loop join;
-- and (2) the cost of scanning the non-union all side is relatively
-- low, such as a small table size, and existing distribution or
-- duplication  
--
-- This is an ORCA feature. The plan shape is only verified for ORCA
-- plans. Correctness of the plans can be verified by the # of output
