-- Used to be a bug where we release the gangs and reset context. The
-- subsequent retry succeeds with the new gang. When resetting the
-- session, as the warning message says, we drop ongoing temporary
-- namespace. However, whenever new temporary namespace is created, we
-- install shmem_exit callback for this namespace clean up. We earlier
-- missed to uninstall this callback on resetting the gang. That was
-- the reason this test exposed out of shmem_exit slots. Currently
-- MAX_ON_EXITS is set to 20 hence creates 20 transactions. Erroring
-- commit_prepared first time is used as vehicle to trigger gang
-- reset.
