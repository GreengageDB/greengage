 *
 *	A NOTE ABOUT SIGNAL HANDLING ACROSS THE VARIOUS PLATFORMS.
 *
 *	pg_config.h defines the macro HAVE_POSIX_SIGNALS for some platforms and
 *	not for others.  We use that here to decide how to handle signalling.
 *
 *	Ultrix and SunOS provide BSD signal(2) semantics by default.
 *
 *	SVID2 and POSIX signal(2) semantics differ from BSD signal(2)
 *	semantics.  We can use the POSIX sigaction(2) on systems that
 *	allow us to request restartable signals (SA_RESTART).
 *
 *	Some systems don't allow restartable signals at all unless we
 *	link to a special BSD library.
 *
 *	We devoutly hope that there aren't any Unix-oid systems that provide
 *	neither POSIX signals nor BSD signals.  The alternative is to do
 *	signal-handler reinstallation, which doesn't work well at all.
 *
 *	Windows, of course, is resolutely in a class by itself.  In the backend,
 *	we don't use this file at all; src/backend/port/win32/signal.c provides
 *	pqsignal() for the backend environment.  Frontend programs can use
 *	this version of pqsignal() if they wish, but beware that Windows
 *	requires signal-handler reinstallation, because indeed it provides
 *	neither POSIX signals nor BSD signals :-(
