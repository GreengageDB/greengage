Feature: Tests for gpinitstandby feature

    Scenario: gpinitstandby with -n option (manually start standby coordinator)
        Given the database is running
        And the standby is not initialized
        And the user runs gpinitstandby with options " "
        Then gpinitstandby should return a return code of 0
        And verify the standby coordinator entries in catalog
        And the user runs gpinitstandby with options "-n"
