        And the user runs command "mkdir ../gpAux/gpdemo/datadirs/dbfast_mirror1; mkdir ../gpAux/gpdemo/datadirs/dbfast_mirror2; mkdir ../gpAux/gpdemo/datadirs/dbfast_mirror3"
        And the user runs command "rm -rf /tmp/gpinitsystemtest && mkdir /tmp/gpinitsystemtest"
        And the user runs "gpinitsystem -a -c ../gpAux/gpdemo/clusterConfigFile -l /tmp/gpinitsystemtest -P 21100 -h ../gpAux/gpdemo/hostfile"
        And gpinitsystem should return a return code of 0
        Then gpstate should return a return code of 0
        And check segment conf: postgresql.conf

    Scenario: gpinitsystem creates a cluster successfully when run with -D option
        Given create demo cluster config
        When the user runs command "gpinitsystem -a -c ../gpAux/gpdemo/clusterConfigFile -D"
        Then gpinitsystem should return a return code of 0
        And gpinitsystem should not print "Start Function REMOTE_EXECUTE_AND_GET_OUTPUT" to stdout
        And gpinitsystem should not print "End Function REMOTE_EXECUTE_AND_GET_OUTPUT" to stdout

     Scenario: gpinitsystem creates a cluster with for multi-nic setup and populates table entries correctly
         Given the database is not running
         And create demo cluster config
         #Create hosts file with new host-name
         And backup /etc/hosts file and update hostname entry for localhost
         And update hostlist file with updated host-address
         And update clusterConfig file with new port and host-address
         And update the private keys for the new host address
         When the user runs "gpinitsystem -a -c /tmp/clusterConfigFile-1 -h /tmp/hostfile--1"
         Then gpinitsystem should return a return code of 0
         #Verify entries in the gp_segment_configuration as expected
         And verify that cluster config has host-name populated correctly
         #restore hosts file
         And restore /etc/hosts file and cleanup hostlist file
