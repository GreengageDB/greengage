Feature: ggrebalance behave tests (misc options scenarios)

    Scenario: test 1. Check if cluster has no mirroring.
        Given the database is not running
         And a working directory of the test as '/data/gpdata/ggrebalance'
         And a cluster is created with no mirrors on "cdw" and "sdw1, sdw2, sdw3"
         And all files in gpAdminLogs directory are deleted
        When the user runs "ggrebalance -x 6 --remove-hosts sdw3 -d '/home/gpadmin/gpdb_src/gpAux/gpdemo/datadirs/dbfast, /home/gpadmin/gpdb_src/gpAux/gpdemo/datadirs/dbfast_mirror'"
        Then ggrebalance should return a return code of 1
         And ggrebalance should print "Cluster has mirroring disabled. Can't proceed with rebalance" to logfile with latest timestamp

    Scenario: test 2. Check if cluster can't be rebalanced to a balanced state with given parameters.
        Given the database is not running
         And a working directory of the test as '/data/gpdata/ggrebalance'
         And a cluster is created with mirrors on "cdw" and "sdw1, sdw2, sdw3"
