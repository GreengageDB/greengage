Feature: ggrebalance behave tests (rebalance scenarios)

    Scenario Outline: test 1. rebalance - check scenario, when we remove/add a host and rebalance the cluster (with different parallel size).
        Given the database is not running
         And a working directory of the test as '/data/gpdata/ggrebalance'
         And a cluster is created with mirrors on "cdw" and "sdw1, sdw2, sdw3"
         And database "test_db_1" exists

         And there is a "ao" table "test_schema_1.test_table_2" in "test_db_1" with "100" rows
         And database "test_db_2" exists
         And schema "test_schema_2" exists in "test_db_2"

        Then ggrebalance should return a return code of 0
