# For Developers

To install the libraries necessary for running scripts or testing, a system python of 2.7 must be available, the version of gcc and g++ used to compile python must be available.
On most distributions, python will compiled with the same gcc and g++ verion available from the base packages "gcc" and "gcc-c++".

The command `python -VV` will show the compiler used to compile the version of python being used.
A `make` in from gpMgmt will install the proper libraries provided a gcc and gcc-c++ are present.

To run any of these python scripts, necessary libraries must be installed, and PYTHONPATH must be modified to use the libraries in this path.

```
PYTHONPATH="\$GPHOME/lib/python:${PYTHONPATH}"
```

This will be set automatically with a `source $GPHOME/greengage_path.sh`


## Python Version

System python 3 is currently required.


Where Things Go
---------------

* If you are adding a GP module, please add it to the gppylib dir.

dattimeutils.py  -  Several utility functions for dealing with date/time data

gparray.py

  |
  +- gucdict      - dictionary of guc->value pairs

## Testing Management Scripts (unit tests)

This directory contains the unit tests for the management scripts. These tests
require the following Python modules to be installed: mock and pygresql.
These modules can be installed by running "git submodule update --init --recursive"
if they are not already installed on your machine.

If you installed the dependencies using the above git command, you can run the tests with
make, using the following commands in the current directory:

"make check" will run all of the unit tests, some of which require a GPDB cluster to
be installed and currently running.

"make unitdevel" will run only the unit tests that do not require a running cluster.


If you did not install the dependencies using the git submodule, use the following commands in
place of the above make commands, still in the current directory:

"python -m unittest discover --verbose -s gppylib -p 'test_unit*.py' -p 'test_cluster*.py'" will
run all of the unit tests.

"python -m unittest discover --verbose -s gppylib -p 'test_unit*.py'" will run only the unit
tests that do not require a running cluster.

## Testing Management Scripts (behave tests)

Behave tests require a running Greengage cluster, and additional python libraries for testing, available to gpadmin.

Thus, you can install these additional python libraries using any of the following methods:

1. As root user, to be available globally:

```
sudo pip install -r gpMgmt/requirements-dev.txt
```

2. As gpadmin user, to be available only to gpadmin user, but overriding any overlapping libraries with the specific verions in this requirements file:

```
pip install --user -r gpMgmt/requirements-dev.txt
```

3. As gpadmin, using a virtual env - see additional documentation on using a virtual env on python.org
